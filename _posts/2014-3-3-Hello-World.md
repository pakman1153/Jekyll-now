It is believed that the first glass balls made to be hung on a Christmas tree were produced by a German glassblower in the river valley town of Lauscha in the early part of the 19th century. It was'nt long before locals fell in love with the shiny decorations, and he began producing enough for gifts to be sold in his shop.

It all starts out with a glob of 2000+ degree glass on the end of a pipe.
